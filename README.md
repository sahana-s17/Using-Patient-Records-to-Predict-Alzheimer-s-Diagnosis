# Using-Patient-Records-to-Predict-Alzheimer-s-Diagnosis


Download the zip file containing all files (including the .csv file).

To run the database implementation, make sure you have the .csv file and the alzheimers.db file  in the same folder where the database file was downloaded. Run the notebook from start to finish in order to clean the data, import it into SQL, and run queries to analyze various factors affecting Alzheimer's. 

To run data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, make sure you have downloaded the .csv file and have it in the same folder as where you dowloaded the data_cleaning_analysis_visualization.ipynb and run the notebook from start to finish. Run the cells in order by importing libraries, cleaning data, and plotting visuals to study our data set. 

To run modeling.ipynb, make sure to first change the file path variable file_path depending on the location of the files. 

Then, run each cell in order. You will import the dataset, import from the sklearn library, clean and normalize the data, initialize the models, train and evaluate the models, and generate bar plots to visualize the different metrics demonstrating model performance.
